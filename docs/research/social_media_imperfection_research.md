# Social Media Photography Imperfection Research

## Current Layers Analysis

The existing 5 layers cover:
1. **A: Aggressive Flash** - Lighting issues (harsh, overexposed)
2. **B: Dirty Optics** - Lens/mirror cleanliness issues
3. **C: Trashy Background** - Environmental clutter
4. **D: Motion & Focus Failures** - Technical camera failures
5. **E: The Phone Prop** - Phone visibility in selfies

## Gaps Identified

What's **NOT** covered by the current system:

1. **Color and Tone Issues** - No layer addresses color bleeding, oversaturation, or smartphone HDR artifacts
2. **Human Presence Artifacts** - No layer for awkward body parts, photobombs, or unintentional people in frame
3. **Screen and Digital Artifacts** - No layer for screen glare, notification pop-ups, or digital interface elements
4. **Temporal/Context Markers** - No layer for timestamps, location tags, or "in-the-moment" indicators
5. **Compression and Quality** - No layer for JPEG artifacts, low resolution, or social media compression

## Real Social Media Trends (2024-2025)

From research:
- **Authenticity over perfection** - "Casual Instagram" aesthetic
- **Unfiltered content** - Raw, unedited photos gaining popularity
- **Vintage and retro** - Film grain, disposable camera aesthetic
- **Minimalistic aesthetics** - Less is more, but still authentic

## Common Smartphone Camera Artifacts

From technical research:
- **Color burn/bleeding** - Oversaturated colors, especially in HDR mode
- **Posterization** - Striped artifacts from aggressive color correction
- **Lens flare** - Not just from flash, but from sun or bright lights
- **Chromatic aberration** - Color fringing at edges
- **Digital noise** - Grainy texture, especially in low light
- **HDR halos** - Glowing edges around subjects in high-contrast scenes

## Proposed New Layers

### Layer F: Color Chaos (Smartphone HDR Gone Wrong)
**Purpose:** Capture the aggressive, often unflattering color processing of smartphone cameras
**Keywords:** `oversaturated colors`, `color bleeding`, `HDR artifacts`, `unnatural skin tones`, `blown out highlights`, `crushed shadows`, `posterization effect`, `color banding`
**When to Use:** Outdoor shots, high-contrast scenes, selfies in bright sunlight

### Layer G: Accidental Intrusions (Photobombs & Awkwardness)
**Purpose:** Real life interrupts the shot - other people, pets, or body parts in frame
**Keywords:** `stranger in background`, `photobomb`, `someone walking past`, `random person's arm`, `pet entering frame`, `awkward hand placement`, `elbow in shot`, `partial face at edge`
**When to Use:** Public spaces, candid moments, group settings, outdoor shots

### Layer H: Screen Life Bleed (Digital Interface Artifacts)
**Purpose:** The digital world intrudes - reflections, notifications, UI elements
**Keywords:** `screen reflection in glasses`, `notification banner visible`, `Instagram story interface`, `battery icon showing`, `time stamp visible`, `Snapchat filter remnants`, `face swap glitch`, `AR filter artifacts`
**When to Use:** Modern, tech-heavy contexts, stories, screen captures, glasses wearers
