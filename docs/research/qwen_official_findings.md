# Qwen-Image Prompting Guidelines - Key Findings

## Prompt Length Recommendations

The official guide states:

> **Detailed but not overloaded:** 1 to 3 sentences work well.

## Key Observations

1. **No strict character count**: The guide does NOT specify "50-200 characters" as documented in the knowledge base

2. **Sentence-based guidance**: The official recommendation is "1 to 3 sentences" which is more flexible than a character count

3. **Examples show variety**: The guide includes examples ranging from short single sentences to very long, detailed prompts (like the wedding invitation example with hundreds of words)

4. **Context-dependent**: The guide emphasizes that complexity depends on the use case, not a fixed character limit

## Comparison with Knowledge Base

- **Knowledge base states**: "50-200 characters ideal" with "sweet spot: 80-150 characters"
- **Official guide states**: "1 to 3 sentences work well" (no character count mentioned)

## Conclusion

The knowledge base is **significantly more restrictive** than the official Qwen-Image guidelines. The official docs focus on sentence count and clarity rather than strict character limits. The "50-200 characters" range in the knowledge base appears to be an interpretation or community best practice, not an official requirement.

Real-world examples in the official guide show successful prompts ranging from ~50 characters to 500+ characters, demonstrating much more flexibility than documented.
