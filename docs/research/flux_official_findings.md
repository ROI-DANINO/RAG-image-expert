# Official Flux Prompting Guidelines - Key Findings

**Source:** Black Forest Labs Official Documentation
**URL:** https://docs.bfl.ai/guides/prompting_summary

## Prompt Length Recommendations

The official documentation states:

> **Optimal Prompt Length**
> - **Short (10-30 words):** Quick concepts and style exploration
> - **Medium (30-80 words):** Usually ideal for most projects
> - **Long (80+ words):** Complex scenes requiring detailed specifications

## Key Observations

1. **Flexibility is emphasized**: The official docs use "Usually ideal" for the medium range, not "MUST" or "REQUIRED"

2. **Range is broader than documented in knowledge base**:
   - Official: 10-30 (short), 30-80 (medium), 80+ (long)
   - Knowledge base states: "30-100 words"
   - The knowledge base is slightly more restrictive than the official source

3. **No strict upper limit**: The official docs mention "80+ words" for complex scenes, suggesting prompts can go beyond 100 words when needed

4. **Context matters**: Different use cases have different optimal lengths - the official docs don't enforce a single range for all scenarios

## Conclusion

The current knowledge base documentation is **slightly more restrictive** than the official Flux guidelines. The official docs emphasize flexibility and context-dependent optimization rather than strict word count limits.
