## The 3 New Layers

### Layer F: Color Chaos (Smartphone HDR Gone Wrong)

**Purpose:** To capture the aggressive, often unflattering color processing of smartphone cameras, especially when High Dynamic Range (HDR) is over-applied.

**Key Keywords:**
- `oversaturated colors`
- `color bleeding`
- `HDR artifacts`
- `unnatural skin tones`
- `blown out highlights`
- `crushed shadows`
- `posterization effect`
- `color banding`
- `glowing edges`
- `HDR halo`

**When to Use:**
- Outdoor shots in bright, direct sunlight.
- High-contrast scenes (e.g., a person in shadow against a bright sky).
- Selfies in mixed lighting conditions.
- To mimic the look of older smartphone cameras with less sophisticated processing.

**Example Prompt Snippet:**
`"...shot on an older smartphone, oversaturated colors with blown out highlights in the background, slight HDR halo around the subject..."`

### Layer G: Accidental Intrusions (Photobombs & Awkwardness)

**Purpose:** To simulate the unpredictable nature of real-life photography, where other people, pets, or even the photographer's own body parts unintentionally enter the frame.

**Key Keywords:**
- `stranger in background`
- `photobomb`
- `someone walking past`
- `random person's arm in frame`
- `pet entering frame`
- `awkward hand placement`
- `elbow in shot`
- `partial face at edge of frame`
- `unintentional shadow of the photographer`

**When to Use:**
- Photos taken in public spaces (streets, parks, beaches, cafes).
- Candid moments at events or parties.
- Group photos where not everyone is perfectly posed.
- To add a sense of spontaneity and un-staged reality.

**Example Prompt Snippet:**
`"...candid shot on a busy street, a stranger is partially visible walking past in the background, slight motion blur..."`

### Layer H: Screen Life Bleed (Digital Interface Artifacts)

**Purpose:** To acknowledge that much of our modern life is viewed through screens, and these digital interfaces often "bleed" into our photos in the form of reflections, UI elements, or other digital artifacts.

**Key Keywords:**
- `screen reflection in glasses`
- `phone screen glare on face`
- `Instagram story interface visible`
- `TikTok UI elements`
- `notification banner at top of screen`
- `low battery icon visible`
- `time stamp from phone`
- `Snapchat filter remnants`
- `AR filter glitch`
- `Moiré pattern from screen`

**When to Use:**
- Photos of people wearing glasses.
- Screen captures or photos of screens.
- To create a modern, tech-heavy, or "terminally online" aesthetic.
- When simulating content that is explicitly from a social media story or video.

**Example Prompt Snippet:**
`"...a selfie of a person wearing glasses, with the reflection of their phone screen visible in the lenses, a notification banner is slightly visible at the top..."`
