**Source:** Google Official Blog (The Keyword)

**Date:** November 20, 2025

## Key Observations

### 1. **NO STRICT WORD COUNT LIMIT**

The official Google documentation does **NOT** specify any strict word count limit like "under 25 words" or "15-25 words max."

Instead, the guidance is:

> **"While simple prompts still work, achieving professional results requires more specific instructions."**

This suggests that **longer, more detailed prompts are actually encouraged** for professional-quality results.

### 2. **Recommended Prompt Structure**

The official guide recommends including these elements:

- **Subject:** Who or what is in the image? Be specific.
- **Composition:** How is the shot framed?
- **Action:** What is happening?
- **Location:** Where does the scene take place?
- **Style:** What is the overall aesthetic?
- **Editing Instructions:** For modifying an existing image, be direct and specific.

### 3. **Advanced Elements for Professional Results**

The guide explicitly encourages **detailed, professional prompts** with:

- Composition and aspect ratio
- Camera and lighting details (e.g., "A low-angle shot with a shallow depth of field (f/1.8)")
- Specific text integration
- Factual constraints (for diagrams)
- Reference inputs

### 4. **Example Prompts Are NOT Short**

The examples shown in the official guide are **NOT** under 25 words. They are descriptive and detailed, similar to Flux-style prompting.

## Comparison with Knowledge Base

| Aspect | Knowledge Base States | Official Google Docs State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt Length** | "Under 25 words" / "15-25 words max" | **No strict limit.** "Simple prompts still work, achieving professional results requires more specific instructions." |
| **Complexity** | "Keep it SHORT" / "Don't over-describe" | **Encourages detail.** "Move beyond the basics and consider these advanced elements." |
| **Style** | "Concise keywords" | **Natural language, descriptive.** Similar to Flux. |

## Conclusion

The knowledge base is **significantly more restrictive** than the official Google documentation. The "<25 words" rule appears to be a community interpretation or best practice for **speed**, not an official requirement.

**Official stance:** Nano Banana Pro works with both simple and complex prompts, but **detailed prompts yield professional results.**

The model is built on Gemini 3 Pro, which has strong reasoning and world knowledge capabilities. It is designed to handle **complex, detailed instructions**, not just short keywords.
