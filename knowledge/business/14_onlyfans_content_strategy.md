## 1. Introduction: The AI Creator Landscape

This guide provides a comprehensive strategy for creating and monetizing AI-generated content on platforms like FanVue and OnlyFans. It covers content that sells, effective prompting techniques, and platform-specific best practices.

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | FanVue | OnlyFans |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Content Policy** | Explicitly allowed, with disclosure | More restrictive, no official AI tools |
| **Built-in AI Tools** | Yes (Image Generator, AI Messaging) | No (requires third-party tools) |
| **Competition** | Lower (emerging platform) | Extremely high (3-4M+ creators) |
| **Recommendation** | **Start on FanVue** to leverage built-in tools and lower competition. | Use for established creators or specific niches. |

## 2. What Content Sells Best: The Hierarchy of Profitability

Not all content is created equal. Focus your efforts on what generates the most revenue.

### The Content Pyramid

| Tier | Content Type | Revenue Potential | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S-Tier (Highest)** | Custom Content & Live Streams | ★★★★★ | Premium, personalized, high-ticket items |
| **A-Tier** | Lingerie, Boudoir, Fitness, Feet | ★★★★☆ | Core subscription & PPV content |
| **B-Tier** | Cosplay, Roleplay, Couple Content | ★★★☆☆ | Niche appeal, good for variety |
| **C-Tier (Lowest)** | Behind-the-Scenes, Q&A | ★★☆☆☆ | Engagement & retention, not direct sales |

### Key Takeaway: The 80/20 Rule

- **80% of your content** should be A-Tier and B-Tier to keep subscribers engaged.
- **20% of your revenue** will come from S-Tier content. Save your most explicit or personalized content for Pay-Per-View (PPV) messages and custom requests.

## 3. The Art of the Prompt: Boudoir & Lingerie Edition

This is where you make your money. Mastering the art of the prompt is non-negotiable.

### The Ultimate Prompt Formula

```
[Subject/Character] + [Pose/Action] + [Lingerie/Outfit] + [Setting] + [Lighting] + [Angle] + [Style]
```

### High-Value Keywords

| Category | Keywords |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lingerie** | `elegant black lace`, `intricate floral details`, `silk robe`, `satin slip dress`, `sheer fabric` |
| **Poses** | `arched back`, `S-curve body`, `looking over shoulder`, `hand in hair`, `kneeling on bed`, `lying on stomach with booty lifted` |
| **Setting** | `luxurious bedroom`, `soft white bedding`, `large window`, `elegant hotel room`, `minimalist background` |
| **Lighting** | `soft natural light`, `window light`, `golden hour`, `dramatic shadows`, `backlit silhouette` |
| **Style** | `professional boudoir photography`, `fashion photography`, `photorealistic`, `cinematic`, `8k`, `highly detailed` |

### Example Prompts That Sell

**The "Over-the-Shoulder" (Classic Boudoir):**
```
professional boudoir photography of a woman in an elegant black lace lingerie set, sitting on the edge of a bed with white bedding. She is looking over her shoulder at the camera with a confident expression. Her back is slightly arched, creating a gentle curve. Soft natural light from a large window illuminates her side. Photorealistic, 8k, highly detailed.
```

**The "S-Curve" (Flattering & Artistic):**
```
cinematic shot of a woman lying on her back on a silk sheet, her head turned to the left and legs positioned slightly to the right, creating a flattering S-curve in her body. One hand is raised above her head, resting in her hair. Shot from directly above. Dramatic shadows, golden hour lighting. She wears a delicate satin slip dress. Photorealistic, professional photography.
```

**The "Arch" (Sensual & Empowering):**
```
low-angle shot of a woman on all fours on a plush rug, her back arched gracefully. She is wearing a red lingerie set with intricate details. One foot is kicked up playfully. She is looking directly at the camera with a playful smile. Studio lighting, dramatic shadows. Fashion photography style, highly detailed, 8k.
```

## 4. Effective Boudoir Poses for AI Generation

Anatomy and posing are critical for believable AI images. Focus on poses that create curves and look natural.

| Pose Name | Description | Key Prompt Keywords |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Back Arch** | On all fours, arching the back. | `on all fours`, `arched back`, `cat-like pose`, `one foot kicked up` |
| **The S-Curve** | Lying on back, head and legs in opposite directions. | `lying on back`, `S-curve body position`, `head turned to side` |
| **Over-the-Shoulder** | Sitting or standing, looking back at the camera. | `looking over shoulder`, `shot from behind`, `gentle curve of back` |
| **The Kneel** | Kneeling on a bed or floor, often looking away. | `kneeling on bed`, `looking away from camera`, `relaxed hand position` |
| **Side-Lying** | Lying on side, head on arm, hair splayed out. | `lying on side`, `head resting on arm`, `hair splayed out` |
| **Belly Down Booty Lift** | Lying on stomach, lifting hips/booty. | `lying on stomach`, `booty lifted`, `curve of hips and butt` |

**Pro Tip:** Always specify hand placement (`hand in hair`, `hand on thigh`) and gaze direction (`looking at camera`, `eyes closed`) to avoid awkward AI artifacts.

## 6. Technical Best Practices

- **Image Quality:** Always generate at the highest possible resolution (4K/8K).
- **Training Data (FanVue):** Use 20+ high-quality, well-lit photos of your face from multiple angles and with different expressions.
- **Consistency:** Use the same base model or LoRA for your character to maintain consistency.
- **Disclosure:** **ALWAYS** disclose that your content is AI-generated. On FanVue, this is a requirement. Use your bio, post captions, or a watermark.
