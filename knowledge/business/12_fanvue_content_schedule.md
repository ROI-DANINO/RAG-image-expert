# FanVue AI Creator: Week 1 Content & Generation Schedule

This schedule is designed for a new creator to maximize engagement and revenue during their first week on FanVue, leveraging the platform's built-in AI tools.

**Core Principle:** Post 1-2 times daily on the main feed. Use Stories for casual updates and polls. Reserve your best content for Pay-Per-View (PPV) messages.

**AI Generation Strategy:** Use your 25 daily AI image generations to create content 2-3 days in advance. This builds a backlog and ensures you always have high-quality content ready.
