# FanVue AI Creator: Complete Startup Guide

**Your First Week on FanVue - Content Schedule, Pricing, and Strategy**

This guide provides everything a new AI creator needs to launch successfully on FanVue. It includes a day-by-day content schedule, a complete pricing menu, and strategic advice for maximizing engagement and revenue.

---

## Part 1: Your First Week - Content Schedule

Your goal in Week 1 is to establish a posting rhythm, build an initial subscriber base, and start generating revenue through Pay-Per-View (PPV) content.

### Core Strategy

**Post Frequency:** 1-2 times per day on your main feed. Use Stories for casual updates, polls, and engagement.

**AI Generation Strategy:** FanVue allows you to generate up to 25 AI images per day. Use this quota strategically by creating content 2-3 days in advance. This builds a backlog and ensures you always have high-quality content ready to post.

**Content Mix:** Follow the 80/20 rule. Approximately 80% of your content should be accessible to all subscribers (feed posts), while 20% should be premium PPV content sent via Direct Messages.

## Part 2: Pricing & Monetization Menu

Your pricing should be competitive for a new creator while still being profitable. The goal is to attract subscribers with a reasonable monthly fee, then upsell them with high-value PPV and custom content.

### Subscription Pricing

| Tier | Price | What Subscribers Get |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Subscription** | **$14.99/month** | Access to all feed posts (1-2 per day), ability to send DMs, participation in polls and Q&As. |
| **3-Month Bundle** | **$38.22 (15% off)** | Same as monthly, but rewards longer-term commitment. |
| **6-Month Bundle** | **$67.45 (25% off)** | Best value for fans who want to support you long-term. |

**Launch Promotion:** Offer a **50% discount for the first month** to new subscribers during your first week. This is a powerful tool to convert your initial followers into paying fans. Promote this heavily on social media.

### Pay-Per-View (PPV) Menu

This is where you make the majority of your money. PPV content is sent via Direct Message and is more exclusive and explicit than your general feed content.

#### Photo Sets

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Lingerie Set** | **$10** | 10 high-quality images in a single lingerie set. Your bread-and-butter PPV item. |
| **Themed Photo Set** | **$15** | 10 high-quality images in a themed outfit (e.g., cosplay, fitness, holiday theme). |
| **Boudoir Photo Set** | **$20** | 15 artistic and sensual boudoir-style images. More artistic and intimate. |
| **"Spicy" Set** | **$25** | 10 images that are more explicit than feed content (e.g., topless, implied nudity). |

#### Video Clips (Simulated)

Since FanVue's AI primarily generates images, you can sell "videos" as high-frame-rate photo slideshows or short, looping GIFs.

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Teaser Clip** | **$15** | 5-second looping GIF showing off an outfit or pose. |
| **Themed Video Clip** | **$30** | 15-second "video" (slideshow) with a theme (e.g., dancing, workout routine). |
| **"Spicy" Video Clip** | **$50** | 15-30 second "video" with more explicit content. |

---

### Custom Content Menu

This is your premium, highest-priced offering. Prices reflect the time and effort required to fulfill a specific request. **Always get payment upfront** before creating custom content.

#### Custom Photo Sets

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Custom Lingerie Set** | **$50** | 10 photos in a lingerie set of the fan's choice (from your available options). |
| **Custom Themed Set** | **$75** | 10 photos in a specific theme or outfit requested by the fan. |
| **Fan Sign Photo** | **$30** | A single photo holding a sign with the fan's name. Great for tips and engagement. |
| **"Your Name" Set** | **$100** | 10 photos with the fan's name written on your body (using AI text overlay). |

#### Custom Video Clips (Simulated)

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Personalized Greeting** | **$40** | 10-second "video" saying the fan's name. |
| **Custom Action Clip** | **$120** | 15-second "video" performing a specific (safe and approved) action. |
| **JOI (Jerk-Off Instruction)** | **$150+** | 30-60 second "video" with audio instructions. This is a top-tier, high-demand item. |

### Tip Menu & Other Revenue Streams

Encourage tipping by offering small rewards. Pin a "Tip Menu" post to your profile.

| Tip Amount | Reward |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$5** | A "thank you" message with a heart emoji. |
| **$10** | A previously unreleased selfie. |
| **$20** | Priority response in DMs. |
| **$50** | A short, personalized audio message (text-to-speech). |
| **$100+** | Your eternal gratitude and a spot on a "Top Fans" list (posted monthly). |

**Other Ideas:**
- **Ratings:** Offer "dick ratings" for $10-$20. This is a popular, low-effort item.
- **Simulated "Used Items":** While you can't sell physical items, you can sell photos *of* items like "worn" socks or panties for a fetish-based audience.

## Part 3: Launch Strategy & Tips

### Week 1 Goals

1.  **Gain 20-50 subscribers.** Use your social media to promote your FanVue page. Offer the 50% discount for the first month.
2.  **Send 2 PPV messages.** Track your conversion rate (how many subscribers unlock the PPV content). Aim for a 10-20% conversion rate initially.
3.  **Establish your posting rhythm.** Consistency is key. Stick to your schedule.
4.  **Engage with your fans.** Respond to DMs, answer questions in Stories, and make your subscribers feel valued.

### Promotion Tips

-   **Use Instagram, Twitter/X, and TikTok** to tease your FanVue content. Post SFW (safe-for-work) versions of your images with a link to your FanVue in your bio.
-   **Use hashtags:** #FanVue, #AICreator, #ContentCreator, etc.
-   **Engage with other creators:** Comment on their posts, collaborate if possible.

### Content Tips

-   **Variety is key.** Don't post the same pose or outfit every day. Use your 25 daily AI generations to experiment.
-   **Listen to your fans.** Use polls to ask what they want to see. Create content based on their feedback.
-   **Quality over quantity.** It's better to post 1 high-quality image than 5 mediocre ones.

### Monetization Tips

-   **PPV is your main revenue source.** Don't be afraid to send PPV messages 2-3 times per week.
-   **Price strategically.** Start with lower prices to build trust, then gradually increase as you gain more fans.
-   **Upsell.** If a fan buys a $10 PPV set, send them a message a few days later offering a $20 custom set.
