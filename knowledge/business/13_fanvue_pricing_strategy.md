_# FanVue AI Creator: Pricing & Monetization Menu_

This pricing structure is designed for a new creator to be competitive, attractive to new subscribers, and highly profitable. The strategy is to offer a reasonably priced subscription to build a fanbase, then upsell with high-value Pay-Per-View (PPV) and custom content.

## 1. Subscription Pricing

Your subscription is the entry point. The goal is to get fans in the door.

| Tier | Price | What They Get |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Subscription** | **$14.99/month** | Access to all feed posts (1-2 per day), ability to DM, participation in polls and Q&As. |
| **3-Month Bundle** | **$38.22 (15% off)** | Same as monthly, but rewards longer-term subscribers. |
| **6-Month Bundle** | **$67.45 (25% off)** | Best value, encourages long-term loyalty. |

**New Subscriber Special:** Offer a **50% discount for the first month** to new subscribers. This is a powerful promotional tool to convert followers into paying fans.

## 2. Pay-Per-View (PPV) Menu

This is where you generate the majority of your income. PPV content is sent via Direct Message and is more exclusive and explicit than your general feed content.

### Photo Sets

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Lingerie Set** | **$10** | 10 high-quality images in a single lingerie set. |
| **Themed Photo Set** | **$15** | 10 high-quality images in a themed outfit (e.g., cosplay, fitness, holiday). |
| **Boudoir Photo Set** | **$20** | 15 artistic and sensual boudoir-style images. |
| **"Spicy" Set** | **$25** | 10 images that are more explicit than feed content (e.g., topless, implied nudity). |

### Video Clips (Simulated)

Since FanVue's AI focuses on images, "videos" can be sold as high-frame-rate photo slideshows or short, looping GIFs.

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Teaser Clip** | **$15** | 5-second looping GIF showing off an outfit. |
| **Themed Video Clip** | **$30** | 15-second "video" (slideshow) with a theme (e.g., dancing, workout). |
| **"Spicy" Video Clip** | **$50** | 15-30 second "video" with more explicit content. |

## 3. Custom Content Menu

This is your premium, highest-priced offering. Prices should reflect the time and effort required to fulfill a specific request. Always get payment upfront.

### Custom Photo Sets

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Custom Lingerie Set** | **$50** | 10 photos in a lingerie set of the fan's choice (from your wardrobe). |
| **Custom Themed Set** | **$75** | 10 photos in a specific theme or outfit requested by the fan. |
| **Fan Sign Photo** | **$30** | A single photo holding a sign with the fan's name. Great for tips. |
| **"Your Name" Set** | **$100** | 10 photos with the fan's name written on your body. |

### Custom Video Clips (Simulated)

| Item | Price | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Personalized Greeting** | **$40** | 10-second "video" saying the fan's name. |
| **Custom Action Clip** | **$120** | 15-second "video" performing a specific (safe and approved) action. |
| **JOI (Jerk-Off Instruction)** | **$150+** | 30-60 second "video" with audio. This is a top-tier, high-demand item. |

## 4. Tip Menu & Other Revenue Streams

Encourage tipping by offering small rewards.

| Tip Amount | Reward |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$5** | A "thank you" message with a heart emoji. |
| **$10** | A previously unreleased selfie. |
| **$20** | Priority response in DMs. |
| **$50** | A short, personalized audio message. |
| **$100+** | Your eternal gratitude and a spot on a "Top Fans" list. |

### Other Ideas
- **Used Items (Simulated):** While you can't sell physical items, you can sell photos *of* items like "worn" socks or panties for a fetish-based audience.
- **Ratings:** Offer "dick ratings" for a set price ($10-$20).
