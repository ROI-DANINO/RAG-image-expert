## 0. The POV Decision Framework

### The Golden Rule

> **The camera perspective MUST match the scenario's social context.**

If there's no reason for a second person to be present, **don't imply one exists** through third-person framing.

---

### Three Camera Perspectives

#### **Perspective 1: Selfie POV**

**When to use:**
- Intimate/private moments (bedroom, bathroom, getting ready)
- Solo at home
- Gym changing room / store fitting room
- Quick "fit check" or "mirror pic"
- Any scenario where having a photographer present would be weird/intrusive

**Visual markers:**
- `holding iPhone [model]`
- `mirror selfie`
- `arm visible at edge of frame`
- `phone case visible`
- `flash reflection obscuring phone`
- `front-facing camera quality`

**Example scenarios:**
- Morning in bed (just woke up)
- Post-shower bathroom mirror
- Bedroom lingerie/intimate apparel
- Getting ready at vanity
- Gym locker room check
- Store fitting room try-on

---

#### **Perspective 2: Third-Person (Photographer/Friend)**

**When to use:**
- Public locations (parks, streets, cafes)
- Social situations (with friends, at events)
- Professional/editorial content
- Action shots (running, jumping, dancing)
- Full-body framing + complex background required

**Visual markers:**
- `NO phone visible in shot`
- `shot by friend` or `photographer taking photo`
- `natural hand placement` (not holding phone)
- Can specify camera: `shot on Canon EOS R5` or `shot on friend's iPhone`

**For authentic third-person, add "staged candid" elements:**
- `laughing while walking`
- `looking away from camera`
- `adjusting hair`
- `mid-conversation`
- `slight motion blur`

**Example scenarios:**
- Outdoor OOTD (street, park, beach)
- Coffee shop with friend
- Running in park
- Professional fashion editorial
- Group photo at event

---

#### **Perspective 3: Tripod/Timer**

**When to use:**
- Solo content creator needing full-body shot
- Home outfit check (bedroom, living room)
- "Talking to camera" vlog style
- Full-body but no photographer available

**Visual markers:**
- `tripod setup` or `propped phone`
- `centered framing` (camera is stationary)
- `eye-level or slightly lower angle`
- `slight awkwardness` (don't know exact moment)
- `timer shot aesthetic`

**Example scenarios:**
- Full-body OOTD at home
- Bedroom outfit check (not mirror)
- Vlog-style "get ready with me"

---

### Quick Reference: Scenario → POV Mapping

| Scenario | Correct POV | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Morning in bed, waking up | **Selfie** | Intimate, solo moment |
| Post-shower, bathroom | **Selfie** (mirror) | Private, no photographer present |
| Bedroom lingerie check | **Selfie** (mirror) | Intimate apparel = selfie only |
| Getting ready, makeup | **Selfie** (vanity mirror) or **Tripod** | Solo grooming activity |
| Gym changing room | **Selfie** (mirror) | Private locker room space |
| Store fitting room | **Selfie** (mirror) | Solo try-on moment |
| Home outfit check | **Selfie** (mirror) or **Tripod** | Solo at home |
| Outdoor OOTD (street, park) | **Third-person** or **Tripod** | Public space, friend can help |
| Coffee shop casual | **Third-person** | Social setting, friend present |
| Action shot (running, jumping) | **Third-person** | Requires photographer |
| Professional editorial | **Third-person** | Intentional photoshoot |

---

### How to Use This Framework

**Step 1:** Identify the scenario
**Step 2:** Check the table above for correct POV
**Step 3:** Apply imperfection layers (2-5) appropriate to that POV:
- **Selfie:** Layers A (flash), B (dirty mirror), E (phone prop)
- **Third-person:** Layers C (messy background), D (motion blur for "candid")
- **Tripod:** Layer C (background), slight Layer D (awkward timing)

**Step 4:** Add 2-3 imperfections (don't overload with all layers)

---

## 1. The Core Philosophy

| Traditional Photorealistic | Anti-Aesthetic (THIS GUIDE) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Professional camera settings | Smartphone limitations |
| Perfect lighting | Harsh, unflattering lighting |
| Studio quality | Everyday chaos |
| Flawless execution | Authentic imperfection |
| Clean backgrounds | Lived-in, messy spaces |
| Soft bokeh | Flat focus, deep depth of field |

**The Golden Rule:**
> **If it looks too clean, it looks fake.**
> Add noise, dirt, blur, and bad lighting to create realism.

---

## 2. The Imperfection Layer System

Apply these **5 layers** to convert "AI Art" to "Instagram Content."

| Layer | Purpose | Key Keywords | When to Use |
|-------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **A: Aggressive Flash** | Harsh, reality-exposing light | `direct on-camera flash`, `harsh flash`, `hard shadows`, `starburst flash reflection`, `red-eye effect`, `nightlife photography` | Selfies, indoor low-light, party/night scenes |
| **B: Dirty Optics** | Real cameras/mirrors are rarely clean | `dirty mirror`, `fingerprints on glass`, `dust particles on lens`, `smudged lens`, `greasy lens flare`, `water spots`, `flash reflection obscuring face`, `wiped circle in steam` | Mirror selfies, bathroom, post-shower, gym |
| **C: Trashy Background** | Lived-in spaces, not studios | `cluttered bedroom`, `pile of clothes on chair`, `unmade bed`, `messy vanity`, `random cables`, `cardboard boxes`, `laundry drying`, `everyday objects` | Home settings, casual environments |
| **D: Motion & Focus Failures** | Phones don't focus perfectly | `motion blur`, `shutter drag`, `out of focus hand`, `blurry face`, `camera shake`, `low shutter speed`, `slight noise`, `grainy ISO` | Candid moments, action shots, low-light |
| **E: The Phone Prop** | Phone is part of the story | `mirror selfie`, `holding iPhone 15 Pro`, `phone case visible`, `fingers covering lens`, `flash flare masking phone` | All selfies and mirror shots |

**Example layer combination (Mirror Selfie):**
```
mirror selfie, holding iPhone, fingerprints on mirror (Layer B), harsh flash creating starburst (Layer A), unmade bed in background (Layer C), phone case visible (Layer E)
```

---

## 3. Casual Keyword Bank

### Lighting & Atmosphere

| Vibe | Keywords |
|------|----------|
| **Party / Night** | direct flash, hard shadow, dark vignette, grainy film, disposable camera aesthetic |
| **Morning / Raw** | overexposed window, hazy lens, low contrast, soft blur, morning breath vibe |
| **Sun / Street** | harsh sunlight, deep shadows, lens flare, washed out colors, overexposed highlights |

### Digital Artifacts (Use Sparingly)

- `JPEG artifacts` (subtle)
- `smartphone sensor noise`
- `digital zoom quality`
- `chromatic aberration` (subtle)
- `Instagram filter aesthetic`

---

## 4. Prompt Formula Example

### The "Fit Check" Mirror Selfie

**POV:** Selfie (mirror)
**Camera:** iPhone
**Scenario:** Bedroom, bathroom, gym changing room, store fitting room

**Structure:**
```
[Subject in Outfit] + [Mirror Type] + [The Dirt] + [The Flash] + [Messy Background]
```

**Example:**
```
A mirror selfie of a woman wearing a bikini. She is holding an iPhone in front of her face. The mirror is slightly dirty with fingerprints. A harsh starburst flash reflects off the glass, obscuring part of the phone. The background is a mundane hallway with a pile of laundry. The pose is casual, hip popped. Shot on iPhone, unedited.
```

**Key Elements:**
- iPhone visible in hand
- Dirty mirror with fingerprints
- Flash reflection obscuring details
- Messy, mundane background
- Casual pose (hip pop, relaxed stance)
- Specify "unedited" or "iPhone quality"

---

## 5. Directing Notes

### Stop Trying So Hard

Perfect smiles look staged. Use instead:
- `bored expression`
- `deadpan`
- `mouth slightly open`

### Kill the Bokeh

Phone cameras have deep depth of field:
- `flat focus`
- `everything in focus`
- `deep depth of field`

### Bad Framing is Good

Simulate amateur photographer:
- `awkward cropping`
- `head cut off`
- `too much headroom`
- `off-center composition`
- `Dutch angle` (slight tilt)

---

## 6. Model-Specific Adaptations

| Model | Prompt Length | Style | Example |
|-------|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Flux.2** | 30-100 words | Natural language, conversational | "A casual mirror selfie. Woman in a bikini holding her iPhone. The mirror has fingerprints and the flash creates a bright starburst. Her bedroom is messy with clothes on the floor. Very casual pose, not trying too hard. Looks like a real Instagram post." |
| **Nano Banana Pro** | <25 words | Concise keywords | "Mirror selfie, bikini, iPhone visible, dirty mirror, flash reflection, messy bedroom, casual pose, unedited." |
| **Higgsfield Soul ID** | 50-100 words | Focus on outfit/background | "grace_char mirror selfie wearing bikini, holding iPhone, fingerprints on mirror, harsh flash, cluttered bedroom background, casual hip-pop pose, authentic Instagram vibe" |
| **Qwen Image Edit 2509** | 50-200 characters | Expressive, state what varies | "grace_char taking mirror selfie in bikini, holding iPhone with flash creating starburst on dirty mirror, messy bedroom with clothes pile, casual relaxed pose, unedited phone quality" |

## 9. Layer Application Checklist

When converting any prompt to "anti-aesthetic" style:

- [ ] **Layer A:** Add harsh flash (`direct flash`, `hard shadows`)
- [ ] **Layer B:** Add dirty optics (`fingerprints`, `smudged lens`)
- [ ] **Layer C:** Add messy background (`cluttered`, `unmade bed`, `pile of clothes`)
- [ ] **Layer D:** Add imperfect focus (`motion blur`, `camera shake`, `grainy`)
- [ ] **Layer E:** Add phone prop (`holding iPhone`, `phone case visible`)
- [ ] **Directing:** Use casual expressions, kill bokeh, embrace bad framing
- [ ] **Model:** Adapt length and style for target model (see Section 6)

## 10. Story vs Feed

### The Fundamental Difference

| Aspect | Feed Post | Story Post |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Lifespan** | Permanent (until deleted) | Ephemeral (24 hours) |
| **Purpose** | Curated, intentional content | Raw, spontaneous moments |
| **Style** | Polished BUT authentic | Fully embrace imperfections |
| **Composition** | Follows grid aesthetic | Casual, "in the moment" |
| **Quality expectation** | Higher, more intentional | Lower quality is MORE authentic |
| **Imperfections** | 2-3 selective | 4-7 layers freely |
| **Mood** | "I planned this casually" | "I grabbed my phone real quick" |
| **Prompt keyword** | `authentic Instagram aesthetic` | `Instagram Story style, raw` |

---

### How to Prompt for Each

#### **For Feed Posts:**

Use **selective imperfections** (2-3 elements maximum):

**Example:**
```
[character] mirror selfie wearing casual white t-shirt and jeans, bedroom setting, holding iPhone, flash creating soft starburst on mirror, unmade bed visible in background, natural relaxed hip-pop pose, authentic Instagram aesthetic, polished but casual
```

**What's included:**
- ✅ Flash starburst (Layer A)
- ✅ Unmade bed background (Layer C)
- ✅ Casual pose
- ❌ NOT: dirty mirror, motion blur, awkward crop, grain

**Result:** Looks authentic but intentional—suitable for permanent Feed content.

---

#### **For Story Posts:**

Use **ALL imperfections** freely (4-7 layers):

**Example:**
```
[character] quick bathroom mirror selfie, just woke up, messy bed hair sticking up, holding iPhone, harsh overhead bathroom light, steamy mirror with water spots, awkward close-up crop with head partially cut off, slight motion blur from shaky hand, no makeup, authentic Instagram Story style, raw and unfiltered, spontaneous moment
```

**What's included:**
- ✅ Harsh light (Layer A)
- ✅ Steamy mirror + water spots (Layer B)
- ✅ Motion blur (Layer D)
- ✅ Awkward crop (Directing Note)
- ✅ Multiple imperfections stacked

**Result:** Looks spontaneous, ephemeral—perfect for 24-hour Story content.

---

### Example Comparison: Same Scenario

**Scenario:** Morning coffee at home

**Feed Post Version:**
```
[character] sitting by window holding coffee mug with both hands, morning sunlight streaming through, cozy home setting wearing casual grey loungewear, peaceful relaxed expression, natural window light creating soft glow, lifestyle photography, authentic but polished Instagram aesthetic
```

**Story Post Version:**
```
[character] quick selfie holding coffee mug, messy morning hair, harsh kitchen overhead light, still in wrinkled pajamas, tired but smiling expression, awkward close-up angle with too much headroom, authentic Instagram Story, raw morning chaos, unfiltered
```

**The difference:**
- **Feed:** Curated "morning moment" (planned to look effortless)
- **Story:** Actual morning chaos captured in 2 seconds
